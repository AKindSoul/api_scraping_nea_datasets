# Scraping Meteorological Data from NEA via Data.gov.sg APIs
This is an ongoing (and on-and-off, depending on how much free time I have after work/meetups) personal project to create a data scraper for scraping meteorological data from NEA via Data.gov.sg APIs.
Currently, the datasets I am scraping from are:
1. Realtime Weather Readings across Singapore
- Air Temperature across Singapore
- Rainfall across Singapore
2. PM2.5
3. UV Index (work in progress)
